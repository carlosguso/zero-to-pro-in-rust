# Zero To Production in Rust

This repo is for following the book Zero to Production in Rust by Luca Palmieri. You can purchase it [here](https://www.zero2prod.com) 

In this project we'll be building an email newsletter API.

I've been wanting to get into the Rust Ecosystem and I find myself ramping up in a new language faster when following someone else projects and then extending functionality. So If I end up liking the language you might find extra features build on top of this project that are not part of the book (and we'll be documented in this file for reference).
